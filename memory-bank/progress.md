## Completed Tasks

*   [2025-04-07 06:52:02] Initialized Memory Bank (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `systemPatterns.md`).
*   [2025-04-07 06:52:31] [Architect] Gathered information about the existing Python `mcp-pandoc` server.
*   [2025-04-07 06:55:17] [Architect] Developed and finalized initial plan for TypeScript rewrite (using `child_process`).
*   [2025-04-07 07:22:07] [User Feedback] Identified issue: `pandoc` not available in container; connection timeout during initialization.
*   [2025-04-07 07:27:26] [Architect] Decided on host-service architecture to address container limitation.
*   [2025-04-07 07:30:50] [Code] Created host Pandoc service (`pandoc-host-service/app.py`, `requirements.txt`).
*   [2025-04-07 09:11:52] [Code] Refactored `mcp-pandoc-ts` server to use MCP SDK.
*   [2025-04-07 09:18:11] [Code] Debugged and fixed MCP SDK implementation issues (initialization response, tools/list response format).
*   [2025-04-07 09:19:57] [User Feedback] Confirmed `mcp-pandoc-ts` server now initializes successfully in LibreChat.
*   [2025-04-07 13:31:57] [Code] Implemented file output handling (PDF etc.) via base64 transfer between host and container services.
*   [2025-04-07 14:06:54] [User Feedback] Confirmed PDF conversion and file saving works correctly.
*   [2025-04-07 14:07:02] [Code] Updated Memory Bank (`decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `productContext.md`).
*   [2025-04-07 15:04:00] [Architect/Code] Decided on Git strategy: Treat TS rewrite as new baseline, replace `main` history. Updated `decisionLog.md`, `activeContext.md`.
*   [2025-04-07 15:16:00] [Architect] Finalized plan: Use mandatory `PANDOC_HOST_URL` env var (no default) for host service URL. Updated `decisionLog.md`, `activeContext.md`.


## Current Tasks

*   [Code] Completed local Git cleanup: Committed deletions/additions, renamed current branch to `main`. (Push skipped as no remote exists).
*   [Code] Implement mandatory `PANDOC_HOST_URL` environment variable in `src/server.ts` and update `README.md`.

## Next Steps

*   Confirm successful code modification and documentation update.
*   (Optional) User to create remote repository and push the `main` branch.
